There are two overall branches of analyzing the results from a card sort experiment, Exploratory or Statistical and in some cases both are used, to extract as much information as possible from experiment. The type of analysis is largely dependent on the goals of the experiment. The goal for the card sort conducted in this study have been to explore the general idea of how the users of the TonePrint system group concepts of the TonePrint sharing platform. This both includes which kind of groups they create and which concepts they find to belong together. The sample size of the data is also a factor when analyzing the data, because it may be difficult to derive meaningful statistics from a small sample size. \\
For the card sort conducted in this study 17 have opened the online test whereas few have started and left and One have completed half of it, but only Six have completed the card sort.
