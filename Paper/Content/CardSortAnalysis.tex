\chapter{Card Sort Analysis}
\label{CardSortAnalysis}
%
There are two overall branches of analyzing the results from a card sort experiment, Exploratory or Statistical and in some cases both are used, to extract as much information as possible from experiment. The type of analysis is largely dependent on the goals of the experiment. The goal for the card sort conducted in this study have been to explore the general idea of how the users of the TonePrint system group concepts of the TonePrint sharing platform. This both includes which kind of groups they create and which concepts they find to belong together. The sample size of the data is also a factor when analyzing the data, because it may be difficult to derive meaningful statistics from a small sample size. \\
For the card sort conducted in this study 17 have opened the online test whereas few have started and left and One have completed half of it, but only Six have completed the card sort. Only the Six complete data sets are included in the analysis.

\section{Summary of Results}
\label{SummaryResults}
%
Six subjects have completed the card sort from which all were male aging from 26 to 44 years old with an average at 34.7 years, and they all come from different countries. Through the card sort the subject have constructed a combined total of 32 groups of varying sizes which may be seen in \autoref{Tab:GroupOverview}. \\ 
Before starting the analysis it's desired to create an overview of how the individual cards have been sorted. This is done in a spreadsheet (Lav billag og referere til det) containing all the cards in one column with the names of the groups it's placed in the adjacent columns. The next step as described by \textcite[184]{WEB:DonnaSpencer} when conducting an exploratory analysis is to standardize labels for the groups. This is done by looking at the groups seen in \autoref{Tab:GroupOverview} and look for names that are close to similar or represent the same idea. The purpose of this is to make it easier to compare the groups a card belongs. The standardized labels which is found for this card sort are listed in \autoref{StandardizedLabels}. Choosing the standardized labels is a balance because it at one hand is a great tool for comparing the data and on the other hand it may result in uniting groups where the subjects have had different thoughts. The \textit{Forum} group were found to draw many simmilarities to the other \textit{Community} labels and is was therefore given the same label \autoref{StandardizedLabels}\fxnote{Tabellen skal opdateres}. \\

\section{Group Analysis}
\label{GroupAnalysis}
%
At the first phase of the analysis it's desired to analyze the the groups created by the subjects. The scope is to explore the what kind of groups the subjects think i present for the cards provided for this card sort and how similar and different the subjects thinks.\\  
One of the first thing that becomes clear is that one subject is have created created groups very differently than the other five subject. Subject 6 has chosen to group the cards accordingly to how important he think it is. Even though there may derived some interesting findings from subjects 6's groups they aren't suitable for comparing with the other subject. When looking at the remaining subjects there seams to be several similarities. One  theme that may be reflected by the groups is "social interaction and social media". This is clear by most of the subject making a \textit{community} group while the \textit{Social} group draws similarities to different community groups. Having this alongside two \textit{Profile} groups and \textit{User settings} it seams like the idea of a sharing platform share bonds with that of having one's own place in it. \fxnote{FÃ¥ noget med UserFeed in her} \\
There also is different aspects groups allocated to "Finding TonePrints" where the \textit{Search} and the \textit{Pedal} groups draws many similarities by mainly focusing on library and filter cards. Here the \textit{Search} is also focusing on other features for finding a Toneprint e.g 'TonePrint Description', 'Tags describing a TonePrint' and 'Searching system'.  \\
Another theme that has different takes is that of "Feedback". The \textit{User Feedback} group focus on different aspects of feedback options, whereas half of the group consists of the identical groups \textit{Support} and \textit{Customer Service} which refer to communication options with TC and artists. \\
For the \textit{Technical Aspect} group there is a generally scope of functionalities that the app should be able to do concerning individual TonePrints. Five of the cards in this group is the same thous which \textit{Download \& Tools} is based on, and by adding to more to it there group \textit{TonePrint Software} is formed. Narrowing it down the group \textit{Creating / Editing} may be located, which only focus on the concepts of adjusting parameter setting by yourself or giving your friends the chance. Also the \textit{Hardware / Tool} group is present and is only consisting of the 'Beaming tool' card.\\
The \textit{Subscription} group and the \textit{Artist} group are both small and are concentrated mainly on the cards in which the name of the groups are present. However is there in each group a card that seam misplaced, because it doesn't seam to have any relation to the others, which is more likely to happen for larger groups.\\
The remaining groups are the two \textit{TonePrints} groups and the \textit{Sharing} group. The two large groups consists of more than half of the cards each and is therefore difficult to interpret by them self and their content, because it varies a lot. This also seams to be the case with the smaller \textit{TonePrints} group, which might have been used as a group for cards the subject felt difficult to group. \\
\\
As mentioned is the groups formed by Subject 6 very different than those created by the other subject because he has grouped the cards in order of how important he think they are. This actually gives the interesting opportunity to look for tendencies regarding what he think is important and the groups which already have been explored. When looking at the \textit{Very Important} group it's clear that it's focused on functionalities that by it's own would be an TonePrint app that works fine. There is only two cards in this group that also appears in a community group, whereas one of them only is placed there by a single subject and the other by two. This indicates that Subject 6 doesn't seams to find the community aspect Very important. The groups which appears most in the \textit{Very Important} groups is the \textit{Search} groups and the \textit{TonePrint Software} and \textit{Technical Aspects} groups, whiteout counting the two large groups that often appears because of their wide description.\\
For the \textit{Somewhat Important} there is a bit more mix of which groups that appears. Almost half of the group is related to the \textit{Search} groups while the rest is a bit mixed, however does several \textit{Community} and other "Social interaction" groups appear.\\
The most frequent groups found in \textit{Neutral} is the community related groups, and when looking at the cards this group is based on it's generally is functionalities and concepts that generally describes a profile based sharing platform. There is one card that seams odd compared to the others, which is the 'Beaming Tool'. This card have more in common with the cards in the \textit{Very Important} in terms of function.\\
The \textit{Somewhat Unimportant} group consists of "Filter" cards and cards that regarding "information about or from other users". Four of the five cards is directly concerned with other users.\\
The things that Subject 6 finds \textit{Very Unimportant} is all related to \textit{Community} groups. The cards are \textit{Link to other social media profiles}, \textit{"Other TonePrint users near you" suggestions} and \textit{Comment section}.\\

\section{Card Analysis}
\label{CardAnalysis}
When analyzing the results of a card sort it's not only interesting to look at the groups created and named by the individual users, but also to look at how frequent some cards are grouped together. For this purpose the data from Subject 6 has been excluded because he have grouped them so fundamentally different. When looking at the frequency of cards grouped together a distance matrix is created. Each row of the distance matrix represents a card and the same goes for each column, creating a half matrix where each cell compare two different cards, resulting in each card being compared to one another. For every time two cards have been grouped together the 1 is added to the cell value, which in our case have the cells varying between the values 5 to 0.

%For the remaining subjects they all have created  a group indicating something "Social Media" related. The \textit{Community} and \textit{Social} groups consist of 19 different cards. A overall theme for the cards in these groups is that thy relates to some kind of communication with other people e.g. "Public Forum" or "Link to other social media profile". \\
