\chapter{User Study of The TP Community}
\label{ChapterWorkshop}
The tasks presented in \autoref{TaskAndMethods} serve as proposals for how to include the users as an active part of the design process at TC Electronic in correlation with developing a platform for sharing User TonePrints. The tasks are all considered equally important, but ultimately only one of them is explored in this project due to the restricted timeframe. Through discussions with our company supervisor, task 1 is chosen for this purpose. The following chapter will start with an elaboration on this decision before moving on to the execution and subsequent analysis of the results, including what methods are applied for both parts.

\section{Deciding on a task}
\label{TaskDecision}
As described in \autoref{Task1}, the purpose of task 1 is to investigate how to design the information architecture of the TonePrint community, in order to ensure that the design accommodates to the users' mental model of the system. Many considerations were put in to the decision of conducting this task, including TC's wishes, how well it would fit into a typical SCRUM sprint, the remaining timeframe for this project etc. The impact of all these factors also influenced what methods to consider and how to approach them.

Firstly, an investigation of the information architecture seemed the most fitting to conduct due to the current state of the TonePrint community. TC are at a very early stage of development, as no version of a sharing platform currently exist. TC therefore considered it evident to start with an assessment of how content and features should be structured as a baseline for the future design process.

Secondly, previous investigations in this project have showed how TC follows the SCRUM framework in the shape of 3-week sprints (see \autoref{ThemanticAnalysis}). As such, much of the discussion was on finding a task and suitable method that could easily fit to this timeframe, and task 1 was here considered ideal. the limited time remaining on the project furthermore required to conduct it as a 2-week sprint, and even though this is not the same duration as a sprint at TC, conducting a task in this timeframe will still provide insight into how UX tests can fit to a short time period. Task 3 and 4 could just as well fit this timeframe, but each of them require an existing app to some extend. It wouldn't necessarily have to be a fully functional system, but still one that could represent the appearance and functionalities of the system.

Thirdly, task 5 focusing on creating personas of the typical users of TC products was considered very valuable for TC in their understanding of them. However, this task is too extensive and time-consuming to execute in a 2-week sprint and is in general considered a semester project on its own. If it were to be executed anyway, it would only result in demographical info on the users, which doesn't provide anything new for TC.\\

\noindent
When choosing task 1, further specifying the approach is required, as it proposes two different ones. One of these is through Lo-fi testing which is a great tool, but as it is elaborated on in \autoref{Task1}, it requires a rough idea of how the system should work and how the information should be presented. For the TonePrint community there currently is no rough idea of how it should look, and it would as such make more sense to include the users in shaping the concept and flow of the community from the bottom through a \textit{participatory design procedure}. The approach should then follow the outlined suggestion in \autoref{Task1} by conducting a workshop with potential end-users as subjects in order to explore their mental models of a TonePrint community. \fxnote{Research question?}

\section{Mental Models}
\label{MentalModel}
Before proposing the experimental design and setup of a workshop, it seems appropriate to first define what is meant by \textit{mental models}, and how they are constructed. In \autoref{UXbenefits} it is mentioned that if the developers have the same understanding of how a given product should look and behave, then the users are more likely to have a pleasant experience. Other factors such as the users' hedonic opinions of the product also play a role, but this was also meant as a quick introduction to the term. In general, mental models are types of conceptual models that resides in people minds, as the name implies. In other words, mental models are the users' understanding of how something works. The definition of a conceptual model is already outlined in \autoref{CommunityConcept} as an explanation of how something works, including all concepts in it, and how they relate to each other. For mental models, different people may hold different versions for the same system, and some people may even hold multiple models of the same system, focusing on different aspects of its operation \parencite[][26]{PDF:DonNorman}. \\

\noindent
When it comes to constructing mental models, \textcite{PDF:MentalModelInstructions} defines three different factors that influence this process. These are the individuals ability to utilise existing models that relate to the matter in question, general observations of the outside world, and explanations from other people \parencite[][68-69]{PDF:MentalModelInstructions}. It should be noted that the "existing models" can be both internal and external models of similar systems, as long as they can serve as analogies for the model to be created. When this is put into context with the TonePrint community, it is as such expected that the users will construct mental models on the basis of:
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item Their understanding of how the current TonePrint app works, including TC's influence on this understanding.
	\item Observations of how other users utilise the TonePrint app and currently attempt to share User TonePrints with each other.
	\item What other end-users i.e. guitarists tell them.
\end{itemize}
%
A proper mental model allows the user to predict the outcome of possible actions, even if these actions haven't occurred. In such cases, the cognitive system replaces the stimulus in question with inputs from the mental model, interprets them, and draws a conclusion, further strengthening the mental model for future scenarios \parencite[][64]{PDF:MentalModelInstructions}. For task 1, it's important to remember that the main goal for uncovering mental models is to do so in correlation with assessing how the information architecture should be shaped. \autoref{Task1} already proposes examples of how this could be approached in short, and a further elaboration is therefore required, which will be provided in the following section.

\section{Experimental design}
\label{ExperimentalDesign}
Shaping the information architecture of a system requires multiple steps of generating ideas for content and communicating these, before moving on to testing them with the users \parencite[][356-364]{PDF:InformationArchitecture}. For this task, the first step would as such be to generate ideas for content and features to be included in the TonePrint community, and how they should communicate with each other? Instead of engaging in a phase of generating such ideas, this paper instead suggests to make use of studies already conducted by TC, focusing on the TonePrint community. A study by our company supervisor \textcite{PDF:BrugerWorkshopUserTonePrints}, investigates what is required from such a platform, and the result is given in the shape of a list of content which, if included, would make end-users more interested in using the platform \parencite[][35]{PDF:BrugerWorkshopUserTonePrints}. It's important to note that this content also is produced by the users in a workshop, and by utilizing this information, it will serve as a good starting point. Furthermore, the interview conducted with members of the TC staff previously in this project may also contain suitable content for developing an appropriate strategy for the information architecture.

With the ideas generated, the next step is then to explore the content with the users involved, and a suitable way of approaching this is through the card sorting method. Donna Spencer describes this in her book as \textit{a fairly straightforward tool that helps the developers understand the people they are designing for} \parencite[][6]{WEB:DonnaSpencer}. The method involves users sorting a set of cards into piles of what they find similar either according to predetermined group names, or they can be told to describe the categories themselves after the sort. These are referred to as an \textit{open card sort} and a \textit{closed card sort} respectively. The method is most commonly used for organising, grouping, and labeling elements when the focus is on information architecture \parencite[][10]{WEB:DonnaSpencer}, but this doesn't mean that the information can be structured from this method alone. While card sorting is a great tool for finding out what information belongs together, it doesn't provide answers to how these groupings should interact with each other. Donna Spencer also elaborates that she typically dosen't employ the method on its own because of the just stated reasons and that further user involvement is required for investigating the information architecture \parencite[][15]{WEB:DonnaSpencer}.

Proceeding from the card sort therefore requires methods looking into how the users will put the groupings into context with each other. Methods applicable for this purpose could be \textit{interviews}, where the users are given clarifying questions, or a \textit{survey} could be sent out to reach more people. Ultimately, it is decided to take a more observational approach by having the users explain how to complete specific tasks within the TonePrint community. Before elaborating on how how to specifically adapt this and the card sort, another important factor should be addressed. The subjects have to consist of potential end-users, as they represent the mental models of the people who are likely to use a finished version of the system on a regular basis. As it was mentioned in \autoref{MentalModel}, constructing a mental model is influenced by a persons ability to utilise existing models, among other things. For a more appropriate mental model, the subjects should therefore have to consist of guitarists and bassists who have some level of experience with using the current TonePrint app.

\subsection{The card sorting method}
\label{CardSort}
With the overall scope in place, a deeper look into how the methods should be adapted is needed. Specifying how to employ the card sorting method is done in multiple steps \parencite[][8]{WEB:DonnaSpencer}, where the first is deciding on what is to be investigated. As this already is clarified, attention can be turned to the next step which focusses on fitting specific elements of the methods. Firstly, the question of whether to conduct an open or closed card sort has already been mentioned, and it really depends on how much information is wanted from it. Open card sorts are generally used more frequently, as they convey much more information than a closed card sort, where the group labels are predetermined \parencite[][82]{WEB:DonnaSpencer}. The open card sort is therefore chosen to not only allow people to group cards but also decide themselves, what label they should have.

The next element focusses on whether to conduct it face-to-face or remote. The two deciding factors here are the diversity of TC's customer base and the limited time for conducting the study. TC have already been established as a world-wide known company with customers ranging from Canada to Australia. As such, it is seen as a great opportunity to gather a more diverse collection of responses by conducting a remote card sort instead of only recruiting subjects geographically available. The limited time of two weeks further supported this idea as a remote study can handle itself if it is set up in a proper program. The obvious counter-argument here is that this limits the subjects to only engage in either the card sort or the subsequent workshop tasks, and while this is true, it's decided to still approach it this way. While the card sort takes care of itself, it is possible to run a workshop in-person with a group of end-users at the same time. The time-frame of the workshop is shortened, and as long as the subjects taking part in either the card sort or workshop all are end-user, the job in the future analysis and discussion of this project is to unify the results from the tests. The main concern would be that if the workshop doesn't use the card sort as a starting point, the subjects won't have the necessary tools to complete the tasks, but since they are end-users, they are expected to know the necessary concepts.

The next step before sending the remote card sort to the subjects is the obvious task of choosing content and finding the best way of reaching the correct subjects. As it has already been mentioned, the cards for the card sort are developed from a TC study \parencite{PDF:BrugerWorkshopUserTonePrints} and the interview with the four members of TC's development team (see \autoref{ThemanticAnalysis}), but before formulating them, some considerations should be made to the number of cards. By consulting Donna Spencer, the number should be somewhere between 30 and 100 cards, as fewer than 30 cards may make it difficult to create groups and more than 100 cards might make it too tiring to sort. Nielsen norman group also has opinions to this with a range limited to 40-80 cards \parencite{WEB:NielsenNormanCardSort}. 40 cards are ultimately formulated, each representing a piece of content for the TonePrint community, and during this phase it's important to formulate the content similarly enough to suggest potential groupings while not unnecessarily influencing the card sort. A common mistake when formulating cards is mixing content with functionality, however, in many cases it is possible to rephrase the cards so they are presented at a similar level \parencite[][103-107]{WEB:DonnaSpencer}. 

The card sort is sent to the users as a link in the Facebook group \textit{TonePrint junkies} consisting of more than 4000 TonePrint users around the world, hoping that it will produce some responses. It's however not alarming, should the number of responses be low. Donna Spencer argues that for studies trying to produce statistically valid conclusion, much attention should be given to recruiting the right amount of participants, but for studies focusing on information architecture this isn't particularly relevant \parencite[][130]{WEB:DonnaSpencer}. Nonetheless, as another motivation for taking part in the card sort, the users are informed that they also will take part in a draw for a free TonePrint pedal, by agreement with TC. This is done by providing their email in a short survey following the card sort, where they also get a chance to explain the reasoning behind their created groups, as a way of gathering some qualitative data from the card sort. This survey and the 40 cards are all located in appendix?? \fxnote{Smid cards i appendix + survey'en}

\subsection{Workshop approach}
\label{WorkshopApproach}
With the card sort and workshop tasks completely separated, the general run-time of the workshop is substantially shortened, which should ease recruiting, as the subjects are needed for a shorter period of time. The desired outcome of the workshop is to elicit end-users' mental models of the TonePrint community, but this is not how it should be phrased to the subjects, as this definition is to broad and likely won't make much sense to the them. The mental models should be explored in correlation with the new content that is being added to the current TonePrint concept, and the phrasing should therefore focus on this new content, and how the subjects would want to engage with it.

On the basis of the interview with the developers at TC (see \autoref{Interview}, it's clear that the new content is the possibility of sharing User TonePrints with other users and downloading User TonePrints made by other users. What is included within this new content is investigated with the card sort, but the workshop is also 

%To opgaver er derfor formuleret..
%De er dog kun de overordnede opgaver..
%Man kan altid afholde flere workshops med flere opgaver og gå i dybden med specifikke elementer på den måde

%Gruppe eller individuel
%Papir og Tusch

%Ice-breaker - Når man har stået og grinet sammen er man mere tilbøjelig til at 'svine hinanden til bagefter'
%videooptagelse i stedet for think aloud


%The results of this research appear to confirm that students’ pre-instructional mental models about groundwater change to more valid concepts if they get an opportunity to clarify their ideas using a hands-on experimental model-building approach. Students who receive traditional lecture instruction appear to be more resistant to mental model change.

%Resultatet af undersøgelsen peger mod, at ved brugen af "hands on metoder" kan forsøgspersonerne bedre formidle deres mentale modeller til mere valide koncepter
%ydermere vil vi også bare gerne bruge tusch og papir, fordi et stykke software kræver, at forsøgspersonerne først skal lære at bruge det.



%Til workshop specificeringen:
% - Vi anvender papir og tusch, fordi det er redskaber, der ikke kræver ny læring. Rent kognitivt er folk familiære med dem, og de kan derfor lægge al mental load på opgaveløsningen (Sara har nødvendige kilder)
% - Brugte vi et stykke software, ville de først være nødt til at lære, hvordan de interagerer med det først, og selv hvis de gjorde det, ville det ikke nå op på samme niveau som tusch og papir
% - Endvidere kunne think aloud også overvejes, men det typiske problem med det er, at så vil fokusset blive flyttet væk fra at løse opgaven og i stedet over på tænke på at tænke højt.
% - Husk at inkluder consent form til workshoppen i appendix
% - Hvorfor bruger vi de opgaver, som vi gør? - Vi ser dem som de overordnede nye opgaver i et TonePrint community. Det baserer vi på TC's egne ord.
% - Både individuel og gruppeopgave, fordi folk arbejder forskelligt i kreative processer.


%I forhold til pilottesten:
% - Vi diskuterede, om vi skulle lave omformulere opgaverne men valgte at lade være fordi den rigtige test var med rigtige brugere
% - Kig eventuelt i noter for, hvordan
% - hvad vi ændrede i slides (eller ikke gjorde)

% - Der er forskel på 'desired outcome' og 'purpose' - Vi siger jo ikke til dem, at formålet med workshoppen er, at vi gerne vil udlede deres mentale modeller - Vi vil gerne have dem til at udføre to opgaver for at få deres forståelser af dem - Husk den forskel.



\section{Analysis method}
\label{AnalysisMethod}

\noindent
For the purpose of using the users mental models to shape the IA of the TonePrint Community, it's desired to look at similarities of the mental models. \textcite{WEB:ConceptMapAnalysis} suggest a method for analyzing a teams Shared Mental Model (SMM). SMM represents a mental model shared by a group of people working together i.e  at solving a problem or a task. It's important that there is a some what mutual consensus of the SMM, otherwise it would be difficult for the people working together, because they may not know the purpose of what their fellow team members do and it could cause miss communication. The scope of identifying the SMM in this study is however not to evaluate how well users may work together. It's desired to investigate this SMM let the IA accomodate the different mental models \autoref{TaskDecision}.


\section{Analysis Constructed Shared Mental Model}
\label{ACSMM}
To analyze the SMM it's proposed by \textcite{WEB:ConceptMapAnalysis} to create a Analysis Constructed Shared Mental Model (ACSMM). \autoref{fig:ACSMM} illustrates a very simplistic view of the process of constructing a ACSMM. At the beginning there is the users Individual Mental Model (IMM). These IMM is what is addressed in \autoref{MentalModel}. The next part is to acquire the users Individual Constructed Mental Model ICMM, which is their mental model putted in their own words. In this workshop the ICMM's is visualized be the concept maps created by each subject, as described in \autoref{WorkshopApproach}. The ICMM's is then analyzed and compared, so that a ASCMM may be created for explaining a common mental model shared by the users \autoref{fig:ACSMM}.  

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ACSMM.pdf}
	\caption{Illustration of the process of crating a ACSMM}
	\label{fig:ACSMM}
\end{figure}

The step of going from multiple ICMM to a ACSMM is described in \textcite{WEB:ConceptMapAnalysis} as a ICMM coding phase, a shared analysis phase and a SCSMM construction phase. In the coding phase the concepts, links and cluster depict in the ICMM's are transformed into codes, that is comparable. The coding process for this workshop will not only be conducted for the subjects concept maps, however will it be based on the subjects presentation of their concept maps, which has been recorded \autoref{WorkshopApproach}. This is due to the concept maps being constructed quite different and because when putted to word, a more representative description of the IMM may be derived. In the shared analysis phase the codes from each subject is analyzed in order to determine which items of the ICMM's the subjects shares. To determine this a criterion is set for percentages of subjects sharing an item. \textcite{WEB:ConceptMapAnalysis} suggest 50\% as criterion. Finally is the ACSMM constructed by taking the shared items from the previous step and use them to construct a Concept Map. After this the shared items is used to assembly a model which serves as the ACSMM. 










%\subsection{Shared Analysis}
%\label{SharedAnalysis}
%%
%The next phase is the shared analysis in which the codes derived from the ICMM's is used, in order to find items (concept and links) which is shared between them. In order to determine which items that identifies as shared a criterion needs to be defined. As described in \autoref{ACSMM} it's suggested to set the criterion at 50\% at the beginning, which afterwards may be adjusted. This means that a given item have to occur in atleast in 50\% of the ICMM's to be identified as shared.\\
%To compare the codes they are first typed into tables, for the purpose of gathering the codes for easier overview. The tables containing the codes is \autoref{tab:Subject1Coded} to \autoref{tab:Subject5Coded}. 
%
%The lists containing the subjects individual codes, \autoref{tab:Subject1Coded} to \autoref{tab:Subject5Coded} are compared to each other to find the concepts which is shared. As recommended by \textcite{WEB:ConceptMapAnalysis} is the criterion for a concept to be identified as shared defined as 50\%. The concepts which is defined as shared is listed at \autoref{tab:SharedConcept}(WHich isn't finish). 
%
%It's deemed problematic to use the described steps from \textcite{WEB:ConceptMapAnalysis} to create a ACSMM. This is because the task of the workshop was for the subjects to solve a task with a they have to build up as they go. This gives the users full control in regards to which features that exists in the system, how they works and when they wants to use them. This results in the subjects going different ways around the task and solving it in their won way. This is quite similar to some system in the real world which give you the option to reach a certain goal different ways. This however creates one big problem regarding, them only describing the part of the system, which they uses. This makes it very difficult to compare one persons ICMM with another, because they may have chosen different ways of solving the task and theirby having a minimal of similar concepts in common. This doesn't necessarily mean that the two subject disagree on how the system should work and their mental models might be similar towards the system. They just have chosen different approaches for the task, ehich means that they don't uses the same branches of the system. \\
