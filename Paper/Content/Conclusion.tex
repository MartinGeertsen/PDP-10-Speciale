	\textbf{\textit{How can methods for a human-centered design approach be applied in the design process of the TonePrint Community?}}
\end{quote}

\noindent
The design process of the TonePrint app was analysed on the basis of an interview with TC. In this it was found that the SCRUM framework is an important aspect of the design process, which have to be taken into account when looking at how methods may be applied. Furthermore, it was found that the design process involves little to no user involvement, which means that there is not much previous experience to consider when suggesting methods for the design process. A conceptual model of the TonePrint community was derived from the interview, which then was used as a starting point for formulating the tasks and subsequent methods. These tasks are presented in \autoref{TaskAndMethods}, and each of them focus on different elements and features, where actively involving users is considered beneficial. Task 1 was then chosen to be executed as a part of this project. It focuses on designing the information architecture of the TonePrint community from the mental model of potential end-users, and it resulted in the conceptualised version of the users' understanding of the TonePrint commmunity displayed on \autoref{fig:ConcludingModel}. For the remaining tasks, they were decided not to engage further with, but they may serve as future steps for TC in developing the TonePrint community. Task 2 focusses on the tag feature that intends to make the potential vast amount of User TonePrints easier to navigate between. The proposed method for this is a descriptive analysis, exploring how elicitated  attributes may be transformed into understandable tags. Task 3 focusses on the extend of which self-promoting functionalities should be included in the TonePrint community. For this, it's proposed to conduct an exploratory study of other platforms used for sharing self created music presets. Task 4 focusses on testing different designs of the GUI of the app. It's proposed to conduct an A/B test of different design proposals. Finally, task 5 focusses on defining the user groups of the TonePrint community, where it is proposed to address this by creating personas, representing the users. These might help aiming the focus towards the users in future design tasks.
