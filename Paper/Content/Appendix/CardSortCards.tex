\chapter{Card sort cards}
\label{App:CardSortCards}
The following appendix contains the cards utilised for the card sorting procedure. The card sort was conducted remotely through a web based program followed by a short questionnaire with a few clarifying questions. The cards are here presented in the same order as in the program, but there is no pre-defined order to this. The cards are followed by a PDF of the questionnaire.
