Through \autoref{AnalyzingTonePrintDesign} it's decided to conduct a semi-structure interview focused on evaluating TC's design process of the TonePrint app. The information derived from this interview will than serve as a base when helping shape the design process of the TonePrint community towards a user centered approach. In the effort of trying to keep in mind the purpose of the interview four interview research questions is presented in \autoref{PreparingTheInterview}. When designing the interview each question should serve the purpose of help answering one of the four interview research questions, in order to derive the desired information. Furthermore does the knowledge obtained by exploring the TonePrint app through an heuristic evaluation help framing the predetermined questions towards being context specific. It also provides the knowledge necessary to have a conversation with the developers in terms of having them elaborating their answers and digging into more specific areas of the app during the conversation.

\section{Designing the interview guide}
\label{InterviewGuide}
When planing the semi-structured interview a list of questions have to be prepared which purpose is to ensure that the interview research questions is answered. The interview is conducted in Danish because the team members of the development team are danish and even though conducting it in English might make the results easier to include in this project, might a potential languages barrier could make it more difficult for the interviewees to elaborate their answers. \\
\\
The first of the interview research questions is "\textbf{What is the TonPrint apps developers understanding of their target users and how was it applied in the design of the App?}. Two examples of questions that might help answer this question might be: '\textit{How have your knowledge of your users affected the development of the TonePrint app, and where do you have this knowledge from}' and '\textit{What type of feedback do you receive regarding the TonePrint editor and how do you use this feedback?}'. Even though the two questions differ quit a bit, they both provides information that is relevant for the interview research question. The first questions is directly asking if their user knowledge (understanding of the user) have affected the development, which is almost similar to the Interivew research question. Depending on the answer may the interviewer ask follow up question that could dig deeper into how the knowledge have affected a specific part of the app. When the second question focus on the feedback received it might enlighten how the developers create their under standing of the users.\\
\\
The second interview research question states "\textbf{How was the decision process when deciding on, and designing new implementations for the TonePrint App?}". Examples of questions answering this is: '\textit{How did you decide the information structure of the TonePrint app, regarding both the menu structure and the different ways they may be cattegorize}' and '\textit{What is the reasoning for the differences of the app given the platform used? e.g information of not having a pedal connected, the search function and how the video is played}'. 


\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the TonPrint apps developers understanding of their target users and how was it applied in the design of the App?
	\item How was the decision process when deciding on, and designing new implementations for the TonePrint App?
	\item How did the SCRUM framework affect the design process of the TonePrint app.
	\item Which aspects does the development team find important for the design process of the TonePrint community. 
\end{enumerate}

%Som beskrevet i \autoref{HeursiticEvaluation} har vi valgt at lave et interview for at undersøge udviklings processen ved TC. Ud fra den heuristiske evalueringer har vi fået en forståelse for nogle problemer ved TonePrint appe, hvilket giver grundlag for nogle af spørgsmålende i det følgende interview.
%As it is presented in the project proposals for this master's thesis, the focus is on investigating how a company such as TC Electronic can apply user inputs for the design of future products, before applying this knowledge on the specific case of the TonePrint community. Such an investigation firstly requires a look into the design process of the development teams at TC Electronic, in order to assess how and to what extend user involvement can be applied.

%Acquiring inputs from the targeted users of a product is in general considered beneficial for its development, as these inputs can help, the developers better understand the users needs and requirements. This enables them to counter otherwise problematic design choices. When users interact with new products they form a mental model of how the interaction should be done through their existing knowledge, general practice, and the provided instructions. The most ideal thing though would be to talk directly with the designer of the product, but since this isn't an option, they must rely on the available information from the product itself \parencite[][31]{PDF:DonNorman}. If the mental model of the users and the conceptual model of the developer don't match, it isn't guaranteed that the users will interact easily with the product.

%Involving the users in the design process may as such solve this issue, and depending on what the focus of such user involvement is, there are numerous ways of doing it. For the planning process, it is desired to know the possibilities and limitation for the various factors such as the overall focus for the involvement, possible time limitations, the number of available users, etc. and these may be influenced by the general design process at TC Electronic. In order to map this design process, interviews with different members of the TC staff will be conducted, and as such get a better understanding of any possibilities and limitations of user involvement at TC.


%Firstly it seems relevant to ask TC what they're hoping to acquire from user involvement in general, more specifically, what kind of information are they hoping to get from the users? Questions concerning this could be:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Når i udvikler, hvordan inkorporerer i så jeres viden om brugerne?
%	\item Er der nogle informationer om jeres "target users" som i føler i mangler, når i udvikler produkter?
%	\item Er det forskelligt fra produkt til produkt, hvilken information om brugerne i har brug for, og i så fald hvad er forskellen?
%\end{itemize}
%
%\noindent
%In correlation with this, it also seems relevant to focus on TC's own understanding of their target users. How do they apply their knowledge of them in the design process, and what factors play a role in this, such as genre, geography, economy, gender, etc. Questions concerning this could be:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Den nuværende viden i har om jeres brugere, hvordan har i tilegnet jer den?
%	\item Hvordan spiller forskellen på brugergrupper ind, når i udvikler produkter?
%		\begin{itemize}
%		\item Tilpasser i produkterne til forskellige brugergrupper? (geografi, køn, osv.)
%		\item Hvordan målretter i jeres produkter mod den ønskede slutbruger
%		\end{itemize}
%	\item Har i tidligere gjort brug af brugerinddragelse som interviews, spørgeskemaer, workshops eller lignende, og hvad er jeres erfaring med det?
%\end{itemize}
%
%\noindent
%Next the focus should be on the organisation of TC, in order to find out when users can be involved. By asking about what tools they use in their developing process (both their planning and execution of these) it will be easier to plan when eventual user studies can be conducted and how cumbersome and time consuming they can be. Questions concerning this could be:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Hvor fast er fremgangsmåden for jeres designprocesser?
%	\item Hvad er den typiske procedure for jeres udvikling af produkter?
%	\item Er der forskel på, hvordan i udvikler produkter alt efter hvilken type det er?
%	\item Hvordan har kendskabet til domænet indflydelse på jeres udvikling/design af produkter?
%	\item anvender i nogle bestemte metoder/værktøjer i jeres arbejdsproces?
%	\item Hvordan planlægger i udviklingsprocessen for et produkt?
%\end{itemize}
%
%\noindent
%Finally, the goals and demands that TC set for their products should be explored. How are these applied in the product development, and how do they measure whether they have been reached? This probably is close to the questions regarding who the users are, as a goal just as well may be that the product is user friendly. Nevertheless it is still considered of value to include. Questions concerning this could be:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Hvordan opstiller i krav og succeskriterier for jeres produkter?
%	\item Medregner i brugen i jeres krav? eller brugerne i jeres succeskriterier? hvis ikke, hvorfor sÂ ikke?
%	\item Hvordan indsamler i feedback om jeres produkter?
%	\item Hvilke succeskriterier og krav ser i som de vigtigste for brugerne, og hvordan ville i kunne bruge feedback herom?
%\end{itemize}

%- "Der står sådan her i projektforslaget, derfor er vores intention at starte med det her" - Det skal nok i virkeligheden være ud fra et research question, men oh well..
%
%- For at finde ud af, hvordan brugerinddragelse kan gøres hos TC, er det nødvendigt først at forstå, hvordan arbejds/designprocessen fungerer hos TC.
%
%- Vores forslag er at tilegne os denne viden ved simpelthen blot at spørge dem i et interview-format. (Begrundelse i form af forventninger til det. Måske lidt kilder om interviews?)
%
%- Hvad er vores mål at få ud af interviews med TC, og hvem og hvor mange af dem, vil vi interviewe?
%
%- Hvad vil vi spørge ind til => Hvad er de konkrete spørgsmål?
%
%
%
%
%- It's important to gather information of the design and development process at TC electronics.
%	- This knowledge is important to be able to map which UX methods that are applicable.
%
%- How can we get the necessary information?
%	- By observing the process and analyze the different stages. (Tidskrævene og upræsis)
%	- By getting the information directly from the people that are involved.
%
%- With interviews we have the option to ask follow up questions, whenever there seams to be more information that could be relevant.
%
%- It may be difficult to verbalize how the all the processes are carried out, due to tacit knowledge and Transactive memory.
%
%- Which information is necessary to describe the design and development process.
%	- Does there exist a general model for analyzing a development process?
%	- What do we categorize as necessary knowledge and how do we decide?
