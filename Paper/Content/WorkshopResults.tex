\chapter{User study results}
\label{InformationAchitectureResults}
As it is elaborated on in \autoref{ChapterWorkshop}, the purpose of the card sort and workshop is to elicit mental models of the users' interaction with a TonePrint community platform. In the workshop this is investigated for two specific tasks, which on their own don't provide a full explanation for how the entire information architecture should be. The given tasks are the overall new features going from the current TonePrint app to a TonePrint community, and the results are as such also overall explanations. For further elaborating explanations, the various elements in each task should be investigated on their own as a set of subtasks. The subjects' mental models are derived from their hand drawn concept maps and subsequent explanations of them, which was video recorded, and the purpose of the following chapter is to present the results of this workshop before uniting them with the results of the card sort.

\section{Workshop results}
\label{WorkshopResults}
The workshop was conducted in a meeting room at TC Electronic's headquarters in Aarhus, and five members of their staff served as subjects for this. It's important to note that none of them have been affiliated with either the development or maintenance of the TonePrint application at any point, so they were considered fitting subjects for the workshop. The obvious bias of including developers of the TonePrint app would have meant that the workshop wouldn't have produced mental models representing those of the end-users. One of the subjects, however, was considered a potential bias as he develops templates for User TonePrints. He has not had any influence on the design of the TonePrint app though, so he was included in the individual task any way but instead served as an observer for the group task, leaving the remaining four subjects for this.

For the individual task, the results produced five different hand drawn concept maps, these are all found in \autoref{WorkshopConceptMaps}. The results for the subjects are presented individually including their concept map, depicted with software to make it more presentable and readable, a table of their highlighted content and actions, and codings of their video presentations. For the depicting of the concept maps it was considered insufficient to create a complete remake of their drawings alone, as they differ greatly in terms of structure and detail. In order to balance these differences, the new concept maps are made from their presentation of their drawings. The codings of their explanations are presented with the concept map with the important content and actions highlighted with \textbf{bold text}. This is done to put the content and actions into context and not only have them displayed in a table.

%Forklar, hvad forskellen er på rektangler og aflange cirkler i de concept maps, vi har opstillet. Martins tanke var, at rektanglerne er concepts, og cirklerne er components -ish. Man kan også se det som, at rektangler er overordnede sider, og cirklerne er komponenter i de her sider.

Subject 1 starts from the \textbf{TonePrint App} where he wants to \textbf{Log in} in case he isn't already. Then he enters his \textbf{My TonePrints site} which contains a tab either called \textbf{Friends}, \textbf{Community} or something more fitting. He presses this tab and is directed to either a \textbf{Search Friends} functionality or simply a \textbf{Friends List}. The two could also be combined to include the search functionality within the friends list. He uses the search functionality by writing \textbf{user 1}, so it is the only name in the list, and by pressing the username he enters his \textbf{profile}. On this profile he is presented a \textbf{List of TonePrints} created by user 1. The list is divided into the tabs \textbf{By Name} and \textbf{By Type}. From the list of types, he selects the \textbf{Corona TonePrints} and under this he wants to select \textbf{Warm Corona}. This selection could either be confirmed by an \textbf{add to my list} option or a button with a gear symbol on it, even though he's not completely sure what would happen by pressing it. Instead he proposes pressing the name of the TonePrint which would unveil a heart, giving him the choice of \textbf{liking} the TonePrint. It would also present him with instructions in the shape of \textbf{about}, \textbf{how i use it}, and \textbf{number of users}.\\

Subject 2 starts by opening the \textbf{TonePrint app}, after this he has two options. The user can either open his list of \textbf{subscriptions}, if he's looking for a user that he already has subscribed to, or he can open another \textbf{list} and simply \textbf{search} for user 1. Whatever the approach, the next step is then to hook up a pedal and guitar, and select one of \textbf{user 1's Corona TonePrints}. He selects one of them and \textbf{Loads it to his pedal}. Subject 2 then tries out the TonePrint by playing the guitar, and if doesn't like it, he goes back and selects a new TonePrint. If he does like the TonePrint, he wants to \textbf{highlight} it as one of his \textbf{favourites}, so he can find it at another time. He would also like to \textbf{store it in his pedal}. Finally, by selecting to subscribe to the user, he would expect the system to send him \textbf{notifications}, when the user uploads \textbf{new TonePrints}, either directly in the app or maybe by mail. When all these steps are clear, subject 2 would then expect to unhook the pedal from the app and start playing with the TonePrint in question. \\

Subject 3 starts by opening the \textbf{TonePrint app} and gets a \textbf{notification} telling him that user 1, who he already \textbf{subscribes} to, has uploaded a new \textbf{Chorus TonePrint}. He tabs this notification, sending him directly to the specific \textbf{Chorus TonePrint site}, where he selects \textbf{save TonePrint}. From here he can then go to \textbf{user 1's profile} where he can check out other \textbf{TonePrints made by user 1}. He expects these to be sorted in a \textbf{logical order} such as \textbf{alphabetically} or something more fitting. \\

Subject 4 starts by opening the \textbf{TonePrint app} which he expects to have the same infrastructure as the current TonePrint app. He then navigates to \textbf{User TonePrints} where he expects to find all of his own TonePrints as well as an option called \textbf{cloud library}. By selecting this, he is directed to where \textbf{all user TonePrints} are stored, and he wants find a TonePrint from a user that he already knows. He expects there to be a \textbf{filtering system} of some sort, and he chooses to \textbf{filter by product}, presenting him with a list of all \textbf{cloud based Corona TonePrints}. Subject 4 would then like to \textbf{search} for user 1, directing the list to the Corona TonePrints made by user 1. An alternative approach would be to just search for user 1 in the first place and be presented for all \textbf{user 1 TonePrints}. He considers this a more direct approach, as it only requires one action, but by using the current infrastructure of the TonePrint app, he would expect the filtering system to be a part of the solution. Subject 4 then enters \textbf{User 1’s profile site}, where he is presented the TonePrints of user 1, although just the Corona types given the filtering system. He then clicks on a TonePrint with the intention of \textbf{trying it out in real time}, indicating that he wants to \textbf{transfer the TonePrint to his pedal}. If he then likes it, he can choose to \textbf{save it to his own library} and \textbf{highlight it as a favourite}. He wants an interface like the current TonePrint app, where he can \textbf{Save the TonePrint} and \textbf{Store it in pedal}.

Subject 5 starts by saying it needs to feel as familiar as possible, \textbf{similar to other apps} such as Youtube. Everyone uses these, and they tend to be somewhat similar. In the \textbf{TonePrint app} he therefore imagines a \textbf{magnifying glass icon} in the corner for \textbf{searching}, and he further proposes an \textbf{advanced search} for personalising the search. In either case, he proposes that it should work as a \textbf{meta search option}, where everything fitting to the search criteria within the system is presented to the user. In order to present this more organised, he proposes \textbf{different icons representing different content}. In the case of searching for user 1, the system would then provide a \textbf{suggested user: user 1}. By pressing this, the user is then redirected to all the \textbf{public content for user 1}, \textbf{sorted by products}. From here, he selects \textbf{Corona TonePrints} which unveils a \textbf{miniature view} of all user 1's TonePrints for this product, and when selecting one of these, the user is presented a site with all the \textbf{TonePrint details} and maybe a \textbf{picture} attached to the description. Should he just right click on it or hold a finger on it on the smartphone version, he would see a \textbf{context menu} with the options: \textbf{Beam}, \textbf{clone}, or \textbf{add to personal library}, allowing him to \textbf{edit it} or \textbf{highlight it as a favourite}. Finally, he describes a \textbf{history functionality} which allows him to \textbf{backtrack his actions}, much like in a web browser. As such, he will be able to find a TonePrint, even if he didn't highlight it as a favourite

\subsection{Shared Analysis}
\label{SharedAnalysis}
%
The next phase is the shared analysis in which the codes derived from the ICMM's is used, in order to find items (concept and links) which is shared between them. In order to determine which items that identifies as shared a criterion needs to be defined. As described in \autoref{ACSMM} it's suggested to set the criterion at 50\% at the beginning, which afterwards may be adjusted. This means that a given item have to occur in atleast in 50\% of the ICMM's to be identified as shared.\\
To compare the codes they are first typed into tables, for the purpose of gathering the codes for easier overview. The tables containing the codes is \autoref{tab:Subject1Coded} to \autoref{tab:Subject5Coded}. 

The lists containing the subjects individual codes, \autoref{tab:Subject1Coded} to \autoref{tab:Subject5Coded} are compared to each other to find the concepts which is shared. As recommended by \textcite{WEB:ConceptMapAnalysis} is the criterion for a concept to be identified as shared defined as 50\%. The concepts which is defined as shared is listed at \autoref{tab:SharedConcept}(WHich isn't finish). 

It's deemed problematic to use the described steps from \textcite{WEB:ConceptMapAnalysis} to create a ACSMM. This is because the task of the workshop was for the subjects to solve a task with a they have to build up as they go. This gives the users full control in regards to which features that exists in the system, how they works and when they wants to use them. This results in the subjects going different ways around the task and solving it in their won way. This is quite similar to some system in the real world which give you the option to reach a certain goal different ways. This however creates one big problem regarding, them only describing the part of the system, which they uses. This makes it very difficult to compare one persons ICMM with another, because they may have chosen different ways of solving the task and theirby having a minimal of similar concepts in common. This doesn't necessarily mean that the two subject disagree on how the system should work and their mental models might be similar towards the system. They just have chosen different approaches for the task, ehich means that they don't uses the same branches of the system. \\
