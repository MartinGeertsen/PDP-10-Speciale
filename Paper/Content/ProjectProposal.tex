The TonePrint pedals from TC Electronic allows users to create custom presets from their smartphone application and beam them directly to the pedal. The users can either utilise TonePrints created by professional guitarists or create their own, also referred to as \textit{user TonePrints}. One of the next milestones for this is enabling the users to easily exchange user TonePrints with each other, and thus creating a community within the field of TonePrint pedals.

For TC Electronic it is desired to include users in the exploration of how to design such a community platform, firstly because its development is at an early stage, and secondly because the users may provide crucial informations of their expectation and understanding of how such community should look. On the basis of this it is necessary to explore the design processes in the development teams at TC Electronic in order to find out when and how to include users. In correlation with this, it also seems relevant to address TC's own expectations and wishes in order to find how they match those of the users.

This project will start with an investigation of what methods are applicable for user incorporation at different stages of the design process at TC Electronic. The knowledge obtained from this will then be applied in a case study with the design of a TonePrint community in focus.
